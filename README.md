# Kalman Filter Implementation in Python 

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Kalman Filter in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. The Kalman Filter is a widely used technique for estimating the state of a dynamic system with noisy measurements. In this notebook, we showcase how to apply the Kalman Filter to a specific problem and visualize the results.

## Kalman Filter
The Kalman Filter is a mathematical algorithm that provides an optimal estimate of the state of a linear dynamic system given noisy measurements. It combines predictions from a dynamic model with noisy observations to produce an improved estimate of the system's state.

## Example
The Jupyter Notebook contains a step-by-step example of implementing the Kalman Filter for a specific problem. It includes code cells, explanations, and visualizations to showcase how the filter works.
